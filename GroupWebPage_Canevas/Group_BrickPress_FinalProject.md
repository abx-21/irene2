# Final project : Brick press

Team: Montse Balle, Marie De Meulen, Irène Six

*** A low-tech brick-press in open source, achievable in a Fablab ***


## ISABELLE BRICK-PRESS

Our first prototype is based on the Isabelle brick press machine from Beteze; a multi-disciplinary group of young people based in Barcelona [Beteze.org](https://www.beteze.org).

Their file, in open-source, is made for a welded metal press.  Our initial test, made of 6 mm MDF and all the parts are glued together, gave us the opportunity to try the machine and to find ways to improve the press.

## REVISITED ISABELLE BRICK-PRESS 

Our aim is to make a low-tech brick press that could be assembled, without nails or glue. This means it would be easily transportable, mountable and per definition cheap. Therefor we needed to revisit the way the machine was joined, we had to realize the same machine but in a Fablab approach.
This machine would be useful in the post-flooding period, more exactly for the reconstruction or construction of houses. And the brick presses could also be used in any period in unreachable villages, where it is almost impossible to bring bricks, it would permit to make the bricks in situ, stronger than the ones made in a mould.


## REVISITING THE REVISITED

After we realised the Isabelle press achievable in Fablab, we wanted to really a brick-press that would be easier to use and more compact, so cheaper and easier to carry. We thought of making one where we could exerce the strenght with the foot.


## WHAT NEXT?

The actors concerned by this project are : Beteze at first, then us (3 architecture students of ULB, Brussels), then Trivandrum’s Fablab and we hope a lot of other people through the open-source network. We also hope that people knowing more about the technical aspects, such as engineers will help improve this machine. Our biggest fear is the breaking due to the compression force. Something we tried to solve by using thicker material and the least glue possible. 
We thought about replacing some MDF parts submitted to the biggest compression by metal parts, something we did not have the time to try out. This could be a way to develop the brick-press. Maybe just a few small parts could be substituted to avoid collapsing, this would allow to make a way cheaper brick press than if it would entirely have been welded in metal.  More affordable because MDF is cheaper and less skilled labour would be needed.

To conclude, our goal in not only to help people in post-flooding situation, but to help people in general rebuilding or just building houses with locally available raw materials.
And how? By creating the cheapest brick-press we can. 
Why cheap? Because it is made in MDF in a Fablab, light to transport and easy to assemble. It would allow families, who could maybe not afford it, to build solid houses and to use the money they would have used to buy bricks for something else.
Why a brick-press? It would help people in unreachable villages where it is too difficult to bring bricks. It would permit to save money and to create stronger bricks than the one made by hand with a mould.
The extended network of Fablabs would permit a quick distribution of the file. This file would be in open source and could be improved by other people. We hope this machine will just evolve with the time and needs and will stay affordable for everybody.
