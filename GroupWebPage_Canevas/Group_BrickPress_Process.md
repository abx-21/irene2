### THE SHELTER'S STRUCTURE

Following past summer’s floods in Kerala, India, we, Belgian architecture students, had to create an object to help Indian people. We first heard they got a kind of emergency kit with a tarpaulin and various other things. Our first idea was to create an innovative structure to support the tarpaulin, so the people in camps could easily build shelters. Michael (an engineer and logistician) told us people were *“staying in camps many years”* and *“people in camps have no education and even the things you and I find simple can be very challenging for them”* *“IOM and UNCHR who helps to build them (the shelters)”*.  We tried to build some structures but we had some trouble with the size of the tarpaulin that was way to small to build en entire shelter for one family. After that we learned that shelters built with tarpaulin, even the ones build by engineers from NGO’s, were not resisting well to really heavy rainfall.


### THE KITCHEN

For those reasons, we decided to work on the social aspects in the camps; therefor we asked ourselves what was so essential to the Indian culture. Our answer came to the food and the entire ceremony around cooking. This queried the women’s position in the camps, as cooking seems to be something really important that has been transmitted from generation to generation. We were already planning to make a kind of mobile kitchen or a tool to build a tandoori oven but after a Skype conversation with Trivandrum’s Fablab we learned that the entire cooking issue was one of the first problems solved in the camps.


### SOMETHING MORE SUSTAINABLE

At that moment we had an answer from an organization from the moment we were still working on the tarpaulin shelter, Nishant Aggarwal from Sewa international *“Regarding your query on tarpaulin, latter is mostly given for initial survival for 1-2 months in areas which are difficult to reach as its relatively easier to transport/construct compared to Tin Sheds/Brick structures etc. However, tarpaulins are ineffective for heavy rains/cold seasons, so they just provide a nominal shelter to tide over the initial period of Relief/Rescue till Govt/Aid arrives. During the next phase of Rehabilitation, they need to move to more permanent structures, which are resilient from floods/earthquakes etc. So, in our opinion, this is where help is needed to provide cost-effective disaster-proof structures which can be built easily, preferably from locally available materials like soil, wood, rocks etc.”*

We still needed somebody on site who could give us more information because Nishant was not answering any longer, through a lot of people we ended to get in contact with Anu Jacob, an evangelist based in Kerala with whom we exchanged some messages and calls. He told us he was working with a team of volunteers, they could build a house made of bricks and corrugated galvanized steel roof sheets for 3.000$. He sent us pictures of those houses and a video [Construction site video Kerala, 2018](https://youtu.be/BE1kMFsjTUY)) showing us how women were carrying 6 to 8 bricks on their head to the construction site. This information really helped us a lot, from those pictures we knew what kind of materials they needed to build new houses and we could even count how many bricks they needed to build an entire house.

According to Anu Jacob, and Nishant : we finally decided to work  on the post flooding phase,  (re)construction, because it seemed to be  one of the main priority to help people. 
Optimizing this kind of constructions could be achieved by increasing the construction rapidity or its solidity. This last point seemed a bit difficult to solve because we want to use local materials and conserve the same construction typology. 
Finding a way to construct even more local and to save money and time could be a solution to help Indians to rebuild their houses, in this way the low-tech brick press makes sense. 
From a picture we counted they needed more or less 2.000 bricks to build an entire house, while damaged houses need far less to be back in state.
The necessary brick presses per village would be minimal because construction is a community activity.

The first phase of the process was mostly based on finding a lot of information rather than building prototypes, we first needed to be sure we would be working on a useful project. All the information we collected and the contacts we managed to have with people based in Kerala, led us to the brick press. Once we were sure this would be our project we started our second phase of process : our tests and prototypes.


## STARTING THE TESTS AND PROTOTYPES

We first had to understand how clay bricks were realised, therefor we made a lot of research and read a lot about clay. Once the clay collected, we needed to analyse it, therefor we had to mix it with water and let it settle for a few days. This gave us its composition, we could mesure the percentage of its compounents due to this we knew our clay was really clayey.

After that we made small clay balls mixed with different materials and let it dry to see which ones would be the most resistant.

At the same time we made a brick mould, we tried to realise a brick but it cam out that our clay was way too sticky. We also started to create a brick-press model we found online in open-source. The moddel we found was the one of a metal press, once realised it permitted us to understand its way of functioning. This permitted us to realise we had to change some specific parts.
